    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Run of River is a proposed whitewater recreation area in the central business district of

        outside and be more active, providing youth engagement opportunities, and building
        community pride. <br>
        Recreation features in and around our downtown Kennebec River Gorge will include a
        whitewater park with enhanced rapids and waves for kayakers, canoeists, and other water
        enthusiasts; terraced seating for enhanced viewing of paddling events; a four-season trail
        system for hiking, biking, cross-country skiing, and more; pristine fishing waters; a
        boathouse/events facility; a riverfront promenade; and an array of parks</p>
